*. This code automatically updates your AWS launch template to the latest AMI of your instance, allowing your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to have the latest version of your instance automatically.
*. This is useful if you have a life cycle policy to make a backup of your instance every day or hour. 

---- EC2
1. Create a launch template for your AMI and in the add the tag "AMI_Template_Update" with the value "True".
2. Create an Auto Scaling Group for your Launch Template , once is configured , go to the details tab and then scroll to tags and add the tag "AMI_DailyUpdate" with the value of "True".



---- IAM
Create a new role and name it "Lambda-role_daily-asg-update"  (or whatever) and add "AmazonEC2FullAccess" and "AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" policies.

---- Lambda 
1. Create a new lambda function and name it "Automatic_AMI_Launch_Template_Update" (or whatever). Cope the code in the file and paste it.
2. Go to configuration tab and add the role created if is not already added.
3. Go to "add trigger" and as a source select "EventBridge" and then select or create existing rule with your trigger times.


---- Notes 
The code working by taking the AMI instance ID that way is there is more than one launch template each image goes to the according template.
Make sure the AMI has the instance ID and then first AMI your select for the launch template is the AMI of the instance you want to backup.
